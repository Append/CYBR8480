## CYBR 8480 Project Milestone 1: Project Ideation and Requirement Analysis
**Assigned: Monday 3/27/17**

### Due Date
Monday April 3rd (4/3/17) at 11:59PM, Discuss idea at Meeting with Dr. Hale 4/4/17 at assigned time block.

### Overview
This project milestone tasks you with developing a project idea, identifying project requirements, and then analyzing them to determine needed resources and a project management plan for the rest of the semester. Towards this goal, you will be required to submit the following by the due date:

* [Executive Project Summary](#executive-project-summary) - What are you doing and why?
 * Goals and Objectives
 * Merit of the Project
* [Project timeline](#proposed-project-timeline) - When will you do it?
 * Define the major tasks and expected time to completion
 * Create and submit a Gantt chart
* [Project-oriented risk list](#risk-list) - What could go wrong in the project and why?
* [Application requirements](#application-requirements) - What does your app/product do?
 * User stories
 * Misuser stories
* [Discussion](#discussion) - Talk to Dr. Hale about your idea

**All materials will be submitted on GitHub, be sure to slack message me with your GitHub Repo link.**

### Executive Project Summary
An executive summary should be evocative. It should capture a reader and make them want to be a part of your idea. In this milestone you will write an executive summary that defines the goals and objectives of your project in language that is easily readable and mental-image evoking. I (or anyone else) should be able to read your executive summary and instantly know a) what you are doing and b) why it is important. Executive summaries should be exciting and interesting. It is the first (and likely the only) chance for you to engage your reader and, in a real world setting, would determine if your product gets funded. An executive summary does not need technical detail to describe interesting functionality. You should mention your product by name without using phrases such as "the team", "the class", "the instructor", "project 2" etc.

#### Submission materials
You should submit a summary document (in markdown format) on your GitHub project repo. Call the file README.md and place it in the top-level directory of your GitHub project.

It should contain the following:

1. A problem statement identifying the problem your product addresses.
1. Project goals and objectives in a numbered or bulleted list that you will undertake to address the identified problem.
1. The merit of accomplishing the project goals and objectives in terms of how it helps end users, society, or particular industries/sectors.

### Grading criteria
Your summaries will be graded as follows following:

| | Meets expectations (9-10) | Some Issues (6-8) | Does not meet expectations (0-5)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Problem statement| Clearly identifies the context of the problem addressed by your project. Answers the question - Why is this of interest? | Problem context not clearly identified, leaves reader wondering what the product is for. | Problem context unclear or not identified. |
|Project goals| Project goals are clear, concise, and in a bulleted list. Efforts are clearly tied to addressing the identified problem. Goals are stated at a high level and are free of technical jargon or unnecessary detail. | Goals are not as clear, 'in the weeds,' or not directly applicable to the problem. | No goals are identified or there are severe clarity issues. |
|Project Merit | The benefits for pursing the project are clear and tied to addressing the identified problem(s). End user, societal, and industrial benefits are stated - if relevant.| Benefits and merits of the proposed work are muddled or not tied to the problem statement. | Merits are difficult to identify or missing entirely. |
|Length| Summary is of reasonable length (no longer than 1 page, not too short)| Summary is slightly too short or too long | Summary is extremely short or long. |
|Grammar, spelling, syntax | Summary is evocative and free of grammar, spelling, or syntax issues. | Summary contains a few syntax, grammar, or spelling issues. | Summary is difficult to read due to glaring grammar, syntax, or spelling issues|
|Use of markdown| Summary should render as the project homepage on your GitHub repo. It should following markdown conventions. | Doesn't perfectly follow markdown syntax or isn't rendered on the repo home page correctly. | Doesn't use markdown or isn't displayed in the repo.|

### Proposed project timeline
An important part of project planning is identifying tasks to be completed to address project goals and arranging those tasks in such a way that they can be completed within a (typically) fixed interval of time. In this class, that interval is the length of the semester. For milestone one, prepare an overall project timeline that identifies the major tasks to be completed, estimates time of completion, and arranges those tasks chronologically over the project lifespan (from now until the end of the semester).

**Remember that you only have roughly a month to work on your product, so keep scope in mind**

#### Submission materials
You should create a Gantt chart and identify *major* tasks that span the rest of the semester. I suggest using a Gantt chart creation tool such as [ganttpro](https://ganttpro.com) - but you may feel free to create one in a tool of your choice. Once your chart is created, save it as an image file and display it in your README.md file, beneath your executive summary on your GitHub repo.

#### Grading Criteria
Your Gantt chart will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (9-10) | Some Issues (6-8) | Does not meet expectations (0-5)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Identifies major tasks | Major tasks addressing your objectives (from the executive summary) are identified by name. Set of tasks is appropriate to the objectives and time frame. | The set of tasks is not scoped well (too much or too little) or they do not seem to address the objectives well. | No or few tasks are identified - or they are extremely poorly scoped. |
| Chronologically arranged | Tasks are intelligently arrayed by time. | Tasks are poorly arranged. | Tasks are extremely poorly or not arranged in time. |
| Achievable | Timeline is expectedly achievable given time frame and team size. | Timeline/task achievability is questionable. | Timeline is completely unrealistic.
| Displayed in readme file| Your Gantt chart is accessible in your GitHub project repo on the same page as the executive summary | N/A | Your Gantt chart is not available in your GitHub repo |

### Risk list
As you will probably discover, there are many things that can go wrong when working on a project. Issues with skillsets, technology, team member availability, etc., may arise as the project goes forward. As we discussed in class, there are three options available to deal with project management risks: monitor it (Watch it), mitigate it (do something about it), accept it (give up). For milestone one, you should identify the major sources of risk and what you plan to do about them. Prepare a risk list and rank them by risk level using the standard formula, i.e. impact x likelihood, to describe the top 5 risks that might affect your team's ability to pull off the tasks identified in your timeline and dictated by your objectives.

#### Submission materials
You should prepare a risk list table and add it to your README.md file in your github project repo, beneath your Gantt chart. The table should use markdown syntax such as:

```markdown
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|
|Some risk (40) | 8 | 5 | Some description  | Monitor it by doing...|
```

to generate GitHub-displayable tables such as:

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|
|Some risk (40) | 8 | 5 | Some description  | Monitor it by doing...|

#### Grading Criteria
Your risk list will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (9-10) | Some Issues (6-8) | Does not meet expectations (0-5)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Impact| Each risk has an identified impact factor. Factor should be based on how significant the event would be towards the disruption of your project activities. | Some factors missing or unreasonable. | No factors identified or factors are completely unreasonable |
|Likelihood | Each risk has an identified likelihood factor. Factor is reasonable. | Some factors missing or unreasonable | No factors identified or factors are completely unreasonable |
|Name and description| Risk name and description are appropriate and understandable. | Some risks are unclear. | Most or all risk are unclearly described or descriptions are missing. |
|Coverage and relevance | Identified risks are relevant to the project and cover obvious potential problem areas. | Some coverage or relevance is missing. | Risks do not address obvious potential problem areas or aren't relevant.

### Application requirements
Requirements are extremely important for conducting a successful project. Collecting requirements about an application means understanding what your end user is going to do with the product. To understand requirements we often define user stories and use cases to encapsulate and represent behavior.

#### Submission materials
##### User stories
For milestone 1, you should define the 3 most important user stories for your product. Pay careful attention to structure the user stories as we discussed in CYBR8470. Specifically, submit your user stories using the following template. Include them directly on, or as a link from, your GitHub repo README.md file.

As a **user/role**, I want to **goal** so I can **rationale**.

Markdown syntax for this is as follows:

```markdown
As a **user/role**, I want to **goal** so I can **rationale**.
```

For each user story, also define acceptance criteria.
Your acceptance criteria should define the set of things required to understand when you are done with the user story.

##### Misuser stories
Also think about and define 2 misuser stories. Misuser stories are nothing more than user stories, except for users seeking to abuse your app. Use the same format as above, except replace user with misuser and use the ```goal``` to define the misuse goal. I.e.

As a **misuser**, I want to **misuse goal** so I can **rationale**.

e.g.

As a **Fitbit misuser**, I want to **exploit the Fitbit companion app** so I can **steal user Fitness and GPS data**.

Under each misuser story, identify at least one way you will counter this misuse in your application design.

#### Grading Criteria
User stories and use cases will be graded as follows.

##### User stories
|Each user story | Meets expectations (9-10) | Some Issues (6-8) | Does not meet expectations (0-5)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stated correctly| The user story identifies a user role, goal, and rationale that dictates a user behavior in the product to be created. | A role, goal, or rationale is missing. | Many issues with role, goal, or rationale identification |
|Acceptance Criteria| The user story has a reasonable, well thought out, set of acceptance criteria that dictate when the story is satisfied. | Some criteria are ill defined or ambiguous. Not enough criteria defined. | Many ill-defined or missing criteria.|

##### Misuser stories
|Each misuser story | Meets expectations (9-10) | Some Issues (6-8) | Does not meet expectations (0-5)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stated correctly| The misuser story identifies a user type, goal, and rationale that dictates a potential misuser behavior in the product to be created. | A role, goal, or rationale is missing. | Many issues with role, goal, or rationale identification |
|Mitigation| The user story has a reasonable, well thought out, mitigation plan that dictates how the story will be thwarted. | Mitigation is ill defined or ambiguous. | Mitigation is extremely ill-defined, poorly thought out, and/or unrealistic.|

### Discussion
The last element of your grade for Milestone 1, is just talking to Dr. Hale about your idea and getting some feedback. Come prepared to discuss the technology needed, the overall idea, and your initial thoughts for how you will go about achieving it.
